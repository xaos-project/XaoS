This file contains known XaoS problems

Warning:
This file should become out of date after relleasing 3.1 version.
In this case up to date version will be placed to XaoS homepage


 o XaoS has problems with certain compilters(including some versions of GCC)
   please read README.compilers for more informations
 o Crashes under X11 with higher resolutions
   This should be caused by limits for shared memory area. Please try -nomitshm options.
   This happends often on freeBSD systems.
 o Dos version crashes even with clean dos
   This should be caused (and very often is) by hardware problem of your computer.
   Many computers are configured to run faster than they are build for. So this
   problem is very common on computers running penium 100 at 120 or even 133 Mhz.
   Gcc (compiler used for XaoS) generates VERY optimal code that VERY often overheats
   procesor(for example my 486 after 20 minutes of compiling gets from aprox. 28^C
   to aprox 80^C....It is not easy to notice such problem with other aplications since
   it usually does not have effect for 16bit aplication and falling of windows is
   normal.

   In XaoS this problem causes random crash while xaos is running or crash immediately
   after startup

   Also cyrix 686 are known to have problems with startup menu. In case you are interested
   I may send you version w/o this menu..

   Please browse you setup and put higher waitstates, turn off caches, turn off turbo
   simply everything that should slow down your computer. In case this helps you computer
   is buggy and needs to be configured to lower speed
 o other problems?
   see driver specific documentation
