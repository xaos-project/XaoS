INTRODUCTION:
	XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer.
	It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time 
	fractals) and allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal.  
	Various coloring modes are provided for both the points inside 
	and outside the selected set. In addition, switching between 
	Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types and displaying planes is 
	provided. The first version was a poorly written Mandelbrot 
	view by Thomas later modified by Jan to support high frame-rate 
	zooming. Other additions were later made including autopilot 
	(for those of you without drivers licenses), palette changing, 
	PNG saving, and fractal inversion.

REQUIREMENTS:
	XaoS uses floating point math for its calculations. This may 
	be slow on some computers. The program was developed on 
	a Pentium running at 120 MHz, but it can work quite well (20fps)
	on 486Dx/2. I also received nice letters from users using 
	XaoS at 386/40 or so. Coprocessor is _REALLY_ required.
	Faster computer is better so alpha/600MHZ recomended.  

	To compile XaoS you need ANSI compliant compiler with _GOOD_ 
	optimizations.  Unix version uses configure script. Other 
	platforms uses different ways.  GNU CC is highly recommended. 
	Graphics drivers usually have some additional requirements. 
	(for example xlib for X11, djgpp and allegro for dos port)
	Also fast malloc/free routines are recomended because they
	are called quite often (10 times per frame). For full
	featured XaoS (with image saving code) you also need zlib
	and libpng.

MAILING-LIST:
	XaoS now have following mailing lists at 
	majordomo@horac.ta.jcu.cz

	xaos
	  this list is for general xaos discusion 
	  (ideas, questions, bugreports..)
	xaos-announce
