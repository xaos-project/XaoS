Title:          XaoS - a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer/morpher
Version:        4.3.4
Entered-date:   May 21 2025

Description:    XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer.
		It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape
		time fractals) and allows you to zoom smoothly into the fractal.
		Various coloring modes are provided for both the points inside
		and outside the selected set. In addition, switching between
		Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types is provided. The first
		version was a poorly written Mandelbrot viewer by Thomas later
		modified by Jan to support high frame-rate zooming. Other
		additions were later made including autopilot (for those of
		you without driver licenses), palette changing, PNG saving,
		and fractal inversion.
